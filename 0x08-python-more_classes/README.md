# More Classes and Objects in Python

This repository contains solutions to the tasks for the "More Classes and Objects" project in the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. The tasks are focused on deepening understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

## Project Description

The project consists of several tasks, each aimed at implementing and understanding various aspects of classes and objects in Python. These tasks cover topics such as defining classes, working with instance attributes and methods, using properties, implementing class methods and static methods, string representation of objects, comparison between objects, and solving the N queens puzzle using backtracking.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Simple Rectangle:** Define a basic Rectangle class.
2. **Real Definition of a Rectangle:** Add private instance attributes, properties, and instantiation with optional width and height.
3. **Area and Perimeter:** Add methods to calculate area and perimeter of the rectangle.
4. **String Representation:** Implement `__str__` and `__repr__` methods for string representation.
5. **Eval is Magic:** Implement `__repr__` for evaluation with `eval()`.
6. **Detect Instance Deletion:** Print a message when an instance of Rectangle is deleted.
7. **Change Representation:** Allow changing the symbol for string representation.
8. **Compare Rectangles:** Implement a static method to compare rectangles based on area.
9. **A Square is a Rectangle:** Implement a class method to create a square.
10. **N Queens Puzzle:** Solve the N queens puzzle using backtracking.

## Requirements

- All code is written in Python 3.8.5.
- No external modules are imported.
- Code is checked with `pycodestyle` for PEP 8 compliance.
- Each task is implemented in a separate Python file.
- Usage of each script is described in its respective task description.

## Usage

To run any of the provided Python scripts, simply execute them in a Python environment. For example:

```bash
./0-main.py
